# AI-Powered Product Recommendation System for Dropshipping (Saudi Arabia)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-driven recommendation system** for a **Dropshipping Store in Saudi Arabia**, utilizing **Machine Learning** to recommend products to customers based on their purchase history and customer similarity.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Streamlit** (for Web Application)  
- **Collaborative Filtering Algorithm** (for recommendations)  
- **Cosine Similarity** (for customer similarity analysis)  
- **Data Visualization** (using Matplotlib & Seaborn)  

## ðŸ“Š Project Steps  
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - Created a dataset of customers in Saudi cities (**Riyadh, Jeddah, Mecca, Medina, Dammam, etc.**)  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis.  
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**  
   - Identified top-selling products.  
   - Analyzed customer purchase behaviors.  
3. **Building the Recommendation Model**  
   - Used **Collaborative Filtering** for product recommendations.  
   - Computed **Cosine Similarity** between customers to find purchase patterns.  
4. **Developing the Interactive Web App using Streamlit**  
   - Created a **user-friendly web interface** for displaying recommendations.  
   - Allowed users to input **Customer ID** and receive personalized product recommendations.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project  
1. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn openpyxl
   ```
2. Download the project files (`Dropshipping_Recommendation_System_Saudi.xlsx` and `streamlit_recommendation_app.py`).
3. Run the Streamlit app:
